# ralseibot Contributing Guidelines

Hey, thanks for taking the time to contribute to ralseibot. Before you get started though, it's highly recommended that you take a look through the basic guidelines, as to avoid your contributions being denied.

## General Guidelines

1. **Keep it UT/DR themed** - Whatever the command is, it should be UT/DR themed.
2. **Test your changes** - Before submitting a pull request, make sure your code works by testing it locally.
3. **Follow the existing code style** - Use TypeScript, follow the existing file structure, and maintain consistency with existing commands.
4. **Be respectful** - Keep all content appropriate for all audiences.
5. **Check for duplicates** - Before opening an issue or pull request, check if someone else has already reported the same bug or requested the same feature
6. **Use descriptive commit messages** - Write clear, concise commit messages that explain what your changes do.
7. **Update documentation** - If you add new commands, update [commands.md](commands.md) accordingly.

## Opening an Issue

Whether you have spotted a bug/problem, or just have a feature request, you should create a [new issue](https://github.com/BananaJeanss/ralseibot/issues) with the appropriate template.

### Opening a Bug Report

If you've spotted a bug or a problem, use the Bug Report template when making an issue. Be descriptive when explaining the issue, and add the console output if applicable.

#### Template:

```
**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Run '...' command
2. Click on '....'
3. See error

**Additional context**

```

Once you've filled out the template, add the appropriate label as well to make it easier to keep things organized.

### Opening a Feature Request

If you have a feature request, such as wanting a new command, improving a certain aspect of the bot, or anything in that category, create a new issue with the Feature Request template. Be descriptive when explaining the new feature/command you want.

#### Template:

```
**Describe the problem/suggestion**
A clear and concise description of what the problem or suggestion is. Ex. "I'm always frustrated when [...]", or "Add [...] command that does [...]"

Once you've filled out the template, add the appropriate label as well to make it easier to keep things organized.

## Creating a Pull Request

1. **Fork the repository** and create a new branch for your feature.
2. **Make sure your code builds** by running `npm run build`.
3. **Test your changes thoroughly** using `npm run dev`.
4. **Update the commands list** in [commands.md](commands.md) if you're adding new commands.
